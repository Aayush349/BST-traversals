# ðŸŒ³ Binary Search Tree Traversal Operations in C
Binary Search Tree (BST) Traversal in C

This project implements a full set of *Binary Search Tree (BST)* operations and traversals in C â€” including both *recursive and non-recursive* approaches.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Insert elements into a BST
- Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder traversals (Recursive and Non-Recursive)
- Level-order traversal (Breadth First Search)
- Stack and Queue implemented via custom structures
- Search in BST
- Get height of the BST without recursion

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- *Language:* C
- *Data Structures:* Stack, Queue, Binary Tree
- *Concepts:* Recursion, Tree Traversal, Memory Allocation

## â–¶ Usage

1. *Compile the file*:

```bash
gcc bst_traversals.c -o bst
