Binary Search Tree (BST) Traversal in C

Overview

This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with multiple traversal techniques using C. The program includes both recursive and non-recursive (iterative) methods for Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, and Level Order traversals. Additionally, it includes functionalities like insertion, searching, and height calculation of the BST.
